# Scala Design Patterns - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Scala Design Patterns - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/scala-design-patterns-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788471305), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Design patterns make developers’ lives easier by helping them write great software that is easy to maintain, runs efficiently, and is valuable to the company or people concerned. You’ll learn about the various features of Scala and will be able to apply well-known, industry-proven design patterns in your work.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.


The code will look like the following:
```
class MultiplierIdentity {
  def identity: Int = 1
}
```

This book assumes that the reader is already familiar with Scala. We have provided examples for each chapter in projects using Maven and SBT. You should have some knowledge of either one of these tools and have it installed on your machine. You are also recommended to have a modern and up-to-date IDE installed on your computer, for example, IntelliJ. You are encouraged to open the actual projects, as the examples in this book focus on the design patterns and, in some cases, imports are omitted in favor of space.
